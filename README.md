# Find Change, Make Change
> Find Change, Make Change compiles activist resources, such as a searchable political event calendar, senator information, and a media bias tester in one place, making them easy to find and access.
## Inspiration
In the age of the internet, knowledge is everywhere, yet sometimes this informational overhaul makes it harder, not easier, to actually get to what you're looking for. Jenna and Catherine have both experienced first-hand how difficult it is to find accurate, timely information about protests, bills, and other local activist and political endeavors. Thus, their goal is to make civic engagement as accessible as possible.
## About
Find Change, Make Change compiles diverse political resources into one simple interface. From a searchable activist calendar to senators' contact information and a news fact-checker, the application is a one-stop shop for people at any stage of their journey towards civic engagement, whether they are just stepping into the political world or they are a politician themselves.
## Structure
Find Change, Make Change is a Node.js/Express.js web application, with front-end code written in Pug and CSS. Javascript was used to make and then connect to a mysql database to query information about senators (originally obtained from the government's website) and events (originally obtained from Facebook).
## What's Next
Find Change, Make Change will continue to develop its array of resources by gaining licensure to implement a Facebook event API, which will help us find more events to automate onto our calendar. We will also continue building our WebCrawler in order to create a media bias/fact checker, which will additionally use AI to look at news articles and point out potential fallacies. After that, we hope to spread our platform around and make Find Change, Make Change a well-known platform for organizers and activists so that these movements will become more centralized and accessible to all.
